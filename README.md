> ❓ Did you know? 🤔

> I've built this npm module because I needed a reliable and efficient npm module for listing directories while building another one of my projects, a Visual Studio Code extension called **[New Folder](https://github.com/igorskyflyer/vscode-new-folder)** and I needed to create a custom QuickPick dialog allowing the user to pick a root directory.
